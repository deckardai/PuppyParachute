# PuppyParachute

## Goals

### Understand the code
    
See example runtime values side-by-side with the code.

### Understand change

See the effects of a change in all parts of the code.

Inspect changes and accept them by simply copying a file.

Track behavior changes in version control along with code changes.

### Automatic regression tests

Achieve very high code coverage with few tests and no code change.

Deal with under-tested project, difficult to isolate code, and tough deadlines.


## How it works

* Specify one or more entry-points to run the code. Entry-points can be more or
  less high-level.

* Run the code and record every function call, with parameters, relevant environment, behavior, and return value.

* Compare differences in outputs and behavior of the whole code with previous run.

* Check in the new record as a text file.
